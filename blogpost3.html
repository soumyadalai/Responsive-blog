        <p> Some people are birds and some are trees.</p> <br>

            <p>Some people are always active, doing something or the other, never sitting idle for more than a few moments.
            They are eager to travel, shop at new places, try new food, and some new style; basically they don’t like to
            live in a rut. Every day has to be different, a new acquaintance, a new restaurant, a new activity,
            something different. They are otherwise chilled out but can get very annoyed if there is no change or
            variety in their life. They are the birds, flitting from tree to tree, rarely still, always on the move.
            Though they come back to their nest in the evening, the measure of their growth is how far they fly and what
            more or what new they can do.</p> <br>

           <p>In contrast, you have the stable and stoic fellows, who are rarely fazed by any tragedy and will suffer
            through hardships without a complaint. They generally remain calm, come what may. You will never find them
            brooding or complaining during times of trouble, Nor will you see them elated or gushing over achievements
            or accomplishments. They are a source of strength and support to all those around them. They are the trees;
            that give shade and fruits and flowers in good times and provide shelter and safety during storms. Like
            trees, these individuals become stronger by growing their roots deeper. The measure of their success is not
            how far their branches reach out, or how much fruit they can provide, but how deep their roots are, how
            stable they remain in times of crises and how they can recover from tragedies, where lesser mortals would
            have lost hope.</p> <br>

            <p>While birds will always flock around with other birds, and trees may be a part of a grove or a forest, the
            coming together of the birds and the trees should not be surprising. It is inherent, in nature, that birds
            nest in trees and trees provide shelter to birds and animals.</p> <br>

            <p>This dichotomy exists everywhere.</p> <br>

            <p>In families, the children are often the birds and the parents are the trees who they come back to for
            shelter and support, so that they may fly further tomorrow.</p> <br>

            <p>In companies and institutions, the birds have new ideas and are the innovators who keep the company moving
            forward constantly. They are the ones who are responsible for growth and advancement. The trees maintain the
            routine activities and look after the day-to-day work. This is the stable base that the birds require to
            implement their ideas and innovations.</p> <br>

            <p>In schools and colleges, some students are constantly active and involved in some or other activity and have
            large circles of friends. Conversely, some others like nothing better than to be with their books and a few
            close friends.</p> <br>

            <p> Even among the teachers, there are the birds who teach very animatedly and are always full of action and
            enthusiasm. Then there are the trees whose presence itself is comforting and to whom the students reach out
            when in need of advice or guidance.</p> <br>

            <p>Every so often we see best friends or couples who are the complete opposite of each other.</p> <br>

            <p>On the one hand, we say that opposites attract, while on the other we are surprised when two persons with
            such different personalities bond. We all know that like-minded people get along better with each other and
            when we see a mismatched pair, we presume incompatibility. But that is not the case every time. So how do
            such disparate partners coexist successfully?</p> <br>

            <p>The staid and introverted partner provides stability in the relationship. He or she is like the salt in
            food, the existence of which is noticed only when it is absent or present in excess. The extroverted and
            flamboyant partner provides the spice and variety, without which life would be monotonous and uninteresting.</p> <br>

            <p>Again we draw from our understanding of humans as either birds or trees. The birds spread their wings and
            fly far and wide to extend their influence, but always come back to the tree. When times are tough, during
            rain storms or cyclones, the tree provides refuge to the bird who has to sit and wait away the crisis. The
            tree, on the other hand, is made lively by the presence of the birds. The birds provide a semblance of life
            to the otherwise staid tree. The birds also spread its seeds far and wide.</p> <br>

            <p>While each may be able to exist without the other, life would not be the same. The tree would be devoid of
            liveliness and the bird devoid of safety if they did not get along together.</p> <br>

           <p> It is the way of Nature.</p> <br>

           <p>Neither is complete without the other.</p> <br>
            
           <p>There is a bit of bird and a bit of tree in each of us.</p> <br>

           <p>What are you? Bird or tree?</p> <br>
