        <p> I’m the fed-up female, a psychotherapist who spends her days holding space for others, trapped in an endless
            loop of compassion, validation, and, let’s be honest, way too much active listening for one person to hack.
            Like most underpaid counsellors in this country, I’m getting a little jaded, a bit desensitised, and all too
            familiar with the world’s injustices.</p> <br>

            <p>This blog is my pressure valve. A place to unload the real, raw, sometimes questionable thoughts before they
            ricochet around my mind or, worse, solidify into emotional baggage my family has to sift through. If I’m
            lucky, it’ll also be one of the greatest blogs of all time. By 2026, people from every corner of the world —
            diverse, layered and complex souls, will scoff it up. Or, more realistically, it’ll serve as a digital
            journal that saves me a few bucks on clinical supervision.</p> <br>

           <p>Now that I’ve lured you in with my soft, nurturing charm, I’d like to let you know that I’m bloody terrified
            of men. For a while, this fear has shown up as anger, the same male-bashing crap that bounces around like
            the Taylor Swift brand of feminism. As a shrink I am perpetually aware that anger is just a secondary
            emotion. Gently curled around my fear like a protective mother, keeping me safe from feeling the hurt, the
            rejection, the loss of trust in an entire gender.</p> <br>

            <p>Grown men — I’m tired of resenting them, avoiding them, judging them.
            Weirdly, there was a time in my life I was very close to boys, like most women, this occured in childhood.
            I’m your classic millennial lesbian, from back in the day when the only glimpse of a lezzy on TV was the
            faux-gay pop duo, t.A.T.u. My gateway into further gaydom was an innocent crush on Jasmine from Aladdin — I
            would’ve traded anything to be her tiger, Rajah. Then in 1997, Kate Winslet did that scene on her big boat,
            and it was all over. As straight as cooked spaghetti.</p> <br>

            <p>Back in the ’90s, being a tomboy wasn’t unusual. Most of us were, but that mix of tomboy and emerging
            lesbian made me the perfect bro for the lads. We skated, girl-gakwed, wrestled, and farted into jars.
            Meanwhile, the little mainstream girlies were off dreaming about Jonathan Taylor Thomas or plotting out
            their future as prospective members of ‘The Baby Sitter’s Club’. I didn’t want that life, and neither did
            the boys I ran with. But then, adolescence hit and something shifted. Girls were no longer boring and
            irrelevant, they were now sexual beings, and suddenly, the scruffy lesbian mate was quietly discarded,
            deemed useless.</p> <br>

            <p>Now, don’t get me wrong, my fear of men isn’t just because boys eventually prioritised their stiffys over
            joining me for a skate sesh. The truth is, I never had healthy, loving male figures growing up. All the men
            I knew were one-dimensional at best — abusive at worst. They either objectified women or ignored them
            entirely. Sure, a couple of good eggs crossed my path, but not often enough for me to relax my guard. In the
            tiny city I grew up, this was sadly the story for many young women.</p> <br>

            <p>Fast forward twenty odd years, I’ve done myself no favours as a mental health specialist. The more
            exhaustive part of counselling, is holding space for women who talk about the desire to support themselves,
            their real-life children, and the added burden of emotionally parenting their male partners. They vent about
            the patriarchy and it’s constant oppression, in tandem with a cycle of excuse-making for the patriarchal
            behaviour in their household. I sit in my pretentious chair, listening to this scene on repeat. I counsel
            men too. Many speak to me about being stuck. Genuinely scared to soften in their relationships, or to
            express any emotion to anyone beyond anger. Until you get the boys over sixty, a different story altogether.
            Once the testosterone dips and the ego fades, these old eggs manage to soften their butter. They’ll head off
            to a Kylie concert without giving a toss whether or not Bob from down the road “thinks he’s a poof”. I’m
            mindful my life experiences, coupled with therapy work, clearly fuelling this bias in my life. Though even
            for women who do not engage in a profession as bizarre as mine, we find ways to prime ourselves. To ensure
            we remain aware of danger, to uphold our power by disempowering the other. It’s self-protective and wholly
            understandable.</p> <br>

           <p>Parts of me want to push against such self-protection. For too long, I’ve distanced myself from men, snapped
            at them, and rolled my eyes in disdain. And honestly, it’s fair to feel that way when change is so slow,
            when wage disparity and misogyny so stubbornly perservere in society. But rejecting men doesn’t bring
            balance. Assuming all men are incapable of love is just lazy thinking. To reject them is to reject parts of
            ourselves. Men are born, men need love. Women are born, women need love. They need to love us, and we need
            to love them. Should we be asked to love something that has the potential to hurt us? It seems unfair. Is
            life on this planet meant to be fair? No.</p> <br>
            <p>There are men who are trying. Men who are brave enough to feel, bold enough to call out the bullshit, and
            creative enough to hold a conversation without degrading the women in their lives. I haven’t met many of
            them, but I know they’re out there. In fact, I’m raising one right now. A little boy growing up in a home of
            love, with two parents who are deeply proud of him.</p> <br>

            <p>I’m striving to meet my fear with love, learning to open my heart to men in a way that feels both safe and
            true. It’s hard work sometimes. Given I am not attracted to men, the incentive is less profound. Perhaps if
            my son wasn’t born, I would have continued on my trajectory of ‘othering’ most blokes. I know opening our
            hearts to men is not always simple, life long coping mechanisms are hard to make sense of. Perhaps the path
            forward is curiosity and acceptance. Acknowledging the murmur of fear within me, but also opening my heart
            bit by bit to the men in my life. For my little boy, for me, for all of us. We owe it to ourselves to create
            a world where love and curiosity stand stronger than fear and seperation.
